This guide is still somewhat a work-in-progress and will be updated with more information as I learn things, find improvements, receive suggestions, etc.

In the future I will also be adding images as a helping hand (and to break up the long walls of text).

At time of writing, this run takes roughly 15-20 minutes. XP gains vary depending on when you log in after the previous run, which herbs and trees you're planting and which herb and trees have grown since then.

Using this setup and running [Magic Trees](https://rs.wiki/Magic_Tree_(Farming)), [Palm Trees](https://rs.wiki/Palm_tree_(Farming)), [Fellstalk Herbs](https://rs.wiki/Fellstalk_(Farming)) and tending my [Player-Owned Farm](https://rs.wiki/Player-owned_farm) filled with [Chincompas](https://rs.wiki/Chinchompa_(player-owned_farm)), [Zygomites](https://rs.wiki/Zygomite_(player-owned_farm)) and [Dragons](https://rs.wiki/Dragon_(player-owned_farm)), I was able to get upwards of 300,000 XP during this time. With Bonus XP and DXP Live, this will be much, much higher.

## Patches Overview

These are the places and patches this guide will be visiting during the route. This table is in alphabetical order and should only be used as a reference.

## Preparation

For a single run you'll want to have your saplings ready to go in your bank, the Tool Leprechauns stocked with the best compost you can get or make and some plant cures.

When starting out, your inventory should contain:

- 7x Tree Sapling
- 7x Fruit Tree Sapling
- 8x Herb Seeds
- Urns
- Urn Enhancer (optional)

## Route

Throughout your route you will grab a single compost or plant cure from the Tool Leprechaun. You can dispose of the empty bucket with them if you want, or drop it. The empty vial should always be dropped.

Because the aim of this guide is to maximize Farming XP, you'll pay the farmers to clear your Tree Patches whenever possible. Fruit Tree Patches and Herb Patches will be cleared by you every time you can.

Every step of this guide assumes your tree/herb is finished growing. Depending on when you do the run relative to the last one, your tree/herb may not be done yet or even be diseased. If this is the case, prune/cure them if needed and move on.

Between each patch, you should [Surge](https://rs.wiki/Surge), [Dive](https://rs.wiki/Dive), [Bladed Dive](https://rs.wiki/Bladed_Dive), etc whenever you can. This isn't required, but does speed up your run.

Every time you're at a patch, you should exchange your bucket for a compost bucket when you're done re-planting your tree/herb. Doing it before re-planting can cause weeds to grow, which slows you down.
### Starting Off

Start the run in **Priffdinas**. First head north to the **Meilyr District** and visit the Fruit Tree Patch, note any produce and head south-east to the **Crwys District** and check on your Elder Tree Patch. Then head west and check your Herb Patch, note any produce and head south to the **Trahaearn District** to check your Tree Patch.

Head north to the bank and grab:

- 2 Law Runes
- 2 Fire Runes

### Teleport Gallore

Teleport to **Trollheim** and head towards the **Troll Stronghold** by using the Agility shortcuts. Head inside, go south and through the door on the western wall, then head up the ladder to where [My Arm](https://runescape.wiki/w/My_Arm) is. Check your Herb Patch there and note any produce you may have.

Cabbage Teleport and head north to the Herb Patch, note any produce you got from it.

Teleport to **Lumbridge** and head north, check your Tree Patch close to the bank. Head to the bank west of the Tree Patch, drop off any empty pots and grab the following:

- Ectophial
- 2 Law Runes
- 1 Fire Rune
- 1 Water Rune
- 6 Air Runes

Teleport to **Falador** and head north-east into the park, check your Tree Patch.

Ectophial Teleport and head west, check your Herb Patch and note any produce.

Lodestone Teleport to **Catherby** and head east to check on your Fruit Tree Patch, noting any produce. Head west and go into the bank to drop off your Ectophial, you don't need it anymore from here. You can also drop off any empty pots here. Head north and check your Herb Patch, noting any produce.

Lodestone Teleport to **Tyrannwn** and head north-west to **Lletya**, be mindful of the leaf trap and run or surge through the crossbow trap. You can step over the trap to avoid the damage, but it's faster to just tank it. Check your Fruit Tree Patch and note any produce.

Lodestone Teleport to **Al-Kharid* and head north, check your Herb Patch and note any produce.

Teleport to the **Wilderness** using the **Wilderness Sword** and check your Herb Patch, note any produce. If you don't have the Wilderness Sword, Lodestone Teleport to the Wilderness Lodestone instead and run north through the crater, make sure you have Auto-Retaliate turned off. Keep running north and you'll find the Herb Patch.

Lodestone Teleport to **Eagle's Peak** and head south-east, jump the stile. Head south-east to the Tree Patch and check it. The head north-east to the Fruit Tree Patch, gather and note any produce.

Lodestone Teleport to **Taverley** and head north, check your Tree Patch. Then head south and buy a **Juju Teleport Spiritbag** from **Bettamax**.

### Fort Forinthry and Tree Gnome Village

Lodestone Teleport to **Fort Forinthry**. If you have completed [A Fairy Tale III - Battle at Ork's Rift](https://rs.wiki/A_Fairy_Tale_III_-_Battle_at_Ork%27s_Rift), head east into the [Woodcutter's Grove](https://rs.wiki/Woodcutters'_Grove).

If you haven't completed that quest, but do have access to the Fairy Network, head north and equip your **Dramen** or **Lunar Staff** first, then head east.

Check your Tree Patch there and then take the Fairy Ring to the Tree Gnome Village (Code **CIQ**). Head west, then north and check your Fruit Tree Patch.

If you don't have access to the Fairy Network, Lodestone Teleport to **Yanille** instead and head north-west.

### Karamja

Lodestone Teleport to **Brimhaven** and head north, check your Fruit Tree Patch and note any produce. Use your Juju Teleport Spiritbag and head south to enter the **Herblore Habitat**. Check your Fruit Tree Patch.

### Finishing Up

Teleport to **Ardougne** and head north-east. Check your Herb Patch, noting any produce. This marks the end of the farming run!

While you're here, you might want to deposit everything except your Urns - if you have any left - in the deposit box and tend your Player-owned Farm if you have it unlocked for heaps of extra XP and money.
